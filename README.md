# Puzzle-Generator

# don't read me
This is a puzzle-generating game. You'll be shown two wikipedia thumbnails, and both thumbnails correspond to words where the first 3 letters are the same. Guess the first 3 letters of the two pictures!

(The frontend isn't very well-developed yet, but we're working on it. Very slowly. For now, you can access the puzzle generator by running manage.py (python manage.py runserver), and going to localhost:8000/carpark/quiz/. Note that the give up button doesn't work, and you'll forfeit your points if you use it!)
